                Reflecting on our journey brings tears to my eyes, but these are tears of happiness and gratitude. Remembering the first time we met in the college library, I felt an inexplicable connection, a certainty that you were the one destined for me. Life took unexpected turns, and we faced challenges, but even during our separation, I missed you immensely. The longing for you was intense, and the pain was deep. Yet, we both committed ourselves to healing and self-discovery.
               </p>
               <p>
                Throughout our journey, we weathered storms, navigated through misunderstandings, and learned to comprehend each other's intricacies. You played a pivotal role in emotionally educating me, teaching me the depth of your feelings and the nuances of your moods. Your patience during my struggles and your reassurance were my pillars. You made me the happiest person by becoming my wife – a blessing that I cherish every day.
               </p>
               <p>
                As I recall every New Year's Eve before you entered my life, tears would flow, but since you became my everything, not a single drop has fallen. Your presence turned my tears into smiles, my sorrows into joys. You've been there when I couldn't love myself, offering unwavering support and love. You are my universe, my guiding star, my everything. 🥺🧿🩷
               </p>
               <p>
                So, with all the love in my heart, I ask you, my love, will you start this new year with me? 🥺🧿💗 Will you embark on this journey with me for every single new year to come? Let's celebrate us, our love, our growth, and the beautiful life we've built together. I love you more than words can express, my dearest Bubu. 💗❤️ Here's to forever and always. 🥺🧿💗
